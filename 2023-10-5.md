## Memristors

- The idea of a memristor, its discovery and methods to identify a memristor in
  the wild were discussed.
- Intuition about how the prediction of the existence of such a device was discussed.
- Breakthrough's such as that by HP in creating an actual memristor was discussed.
- Motivations through applications especially in neuromorphic computing was
  discussed.
- Structure of a neurons and the efficiency of our brain in computing was
  briefly discussed.
- Physical Chips such as the Intel Loihi and IBM TrueNorth was discussed.
