## Memristors

- The idea of a memristor, its discovery and methods to identify a memristor in
  the wild were discussed.
- Intuition about how the prediction of the existence of such a device was discussed.
- Breakthrough's such as that by HP in creating an actual memristor was discussed.
- Motivations through applications especially in neuromorphic computing was
  discussed.
- Structure of a neurons and the efficiency of our brain in computing was
  briefly discussed.
- Physical Chips such as the Intel Loihi and IBM TrueNorth was discussed.

The slides are present here: [TODO]

##  HuffDuff: Stealing Pruned DNNs from Sparse Accelerators

- The HuffDuff attack scheme was introduced, which can be used to steal pruned        DNN models from sparse accelerators.
- The motivation for the work was discussed, which is to develop a new attack scheme that can steal       sparse DNN models from sparse accelerators. 
- The threat model for the attack was discussed, which is an attacker who has physical access to the victim's device and is able to observe the off-chip memory access patterns during inference.
- The challenges of stealing sparse DNN models were discussed, which include the fact that sparse DNN models have fewer parameters and that they are often optimized for specific hardware platforms.
- The background on DNNs and sparse accelerators was "partially" discussed, which is necessary to understand the HuffDuff attack scheme.
- The problem statement of the paper was discussed, which is to develop a new attack scheme that can steal sparse DNN models from sparse accelerators.
- The related work was discussed, which includes prior work on stealing DNN models and other security attacks against edge devices.
- The conclusion of the paper was discussed, which summarized the main findings of the work and discussed the implications of the work for the security of DNN models deployed on edge devices.
