# VPR: versatile placement and routing

**Presenters**: Shreeyash Pandey, Chayashree

- FPGA compilation flow was discussed
- Special emphasis on how placement and routing are carried out in FPGAs was
  discussed
- Parallels were drawn between PNR in general and as is carried out by efinix
  for their FPGAs (which uses VPR underneath)
- Opportunities arising from a semi-automatic PNR flow enabled by direct use of
  VPR (if possible) while compiling designs for efinix FPGAs was the key takeaway.
